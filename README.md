# FaceRecognitionWithWebcam

This repo contains sample facial recognition system construction using a computer camera.

## Getting Started

It is a project that includes the process of performing recognition with OpenCV, by giving input to the Convolutional Neural Network Architecture created with the images taken using the OpenCV library, in the same way.

### Prerequisites

'''

Python 3.x.x
OpenCV
Keras
Pandas
Numpy
PIL
Matplotlib
'''

## Model:
-Data: We created ourselves with OpenCV
-Type: Conv2D
-Optimizer: Adam
-Loss for first model: Categorical Crossentropy
-Loss for second model: Binary Crossentropy
